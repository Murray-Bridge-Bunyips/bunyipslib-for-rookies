## To trigger battle:
- During the "Semi-Finals" battle on 7/12, before endgame all robots must already park, two robots must be parked on the ground, in their alliance's zone, while the other two robots must head to the opposing alliance's zone to park on top of the currently parked robot.
- This will give all teams a yellow card
- After this sirens will ring, at which point all robots must be firmly placed on the ground
- After a cutscene, the Judge Robot will descend from the ceiling

**IMPORTANT**: The Judge Robot deals fatal damage to any robots it lands on top of. Make sure all robots are as far away as possible from the top center of the field to avoid damage

# Fight Information
## The Judge
- The Judge Boss Fight has **10,000 HP**, far more then any vanilla boss (barring the final boss's final phase, which is exclusive to the New Game++ exclusive difficulty 'Ultra Diarrhea Death')
- Is the only component that deals damage to overall health bar
- The Judge is equipped with **2 saw blades** mounted onto it's arms
	- The saws are it's main methods of attacking and all attacks made by the saws use the **Sharp** element type
	- **Sharp** type attacks deal extra damage to robots **without extra armour** or accessories that **negate Sharp damage**
- It's size exceeds the legal robot size by **2 times**
- May occasionally use **Shock** based attacks, which have a high chance of applying **Paralysis**
	- If a **Shock** move is landed with a Critical on a robot that is not blocking and has an **exposed control hub**, there is a **100%** chance of applying **Temporary Shutdown**, another exclusive status effect borrowed from the final boss
	- These moves are always telegraphed by a loud buzzing and spark effect on The Judge 1 turn prior
- If **The Referee is defeated prior to the Judge**, the Judge **gains an extra turn**, during which it's attacks deal half damage
## The Head Referee
- Has **1000 HP**, independent of the main Judge component
	- Upon this health reaching 0, they will be incapacitated for 3 turns (18 seconds)
	- While incapacitated, the main Judge component takes 1.5x damage and deals 0.8x damage
	- After the 3 turns is up, they will restore full health and resume battle 
- They are **resistant to most types of attack**, exclusions being that they fully block **Water** based attacks and take slightly extra damage to **Artefact** based attacked 
- Has the ability to **Smite** a robot:
	- Deals 50% of the robot's base health 
	- Type is **Almighty**, meaning it is impossible to be resistant to smiting
	- Has the chance to inflict **Paralysis** for 3 turns (18 seconds)
	- Is signified **4 turns (24 seconds) earlier**, with the targeted robot signified **1 turn before smiting**
		- Blocking the smite reduces damage, changes applied status effect to **Slow+**, and also **reduces chance of the effect landing**

	- They are **incapable** of casting status effect spells **while charging** a **Smite**

		- Will pick up a robot, stopping it from performing any actions
			- Team members also are **unable to apply any effects or heal the captured robot**
		- After 2 turns, it will slam the robot down, dealing **95%** damage
			- If it lands on a robot, that robot will take damage equal to (***robot weight in KG*** x 20)
	- Does **2x** damage
	- Takes **1.7x** damage (health is equivalent to (700 x (6 - ***times knocked down***))
- Otherwise, the Head Referee will die with the Judge
## Unique Mechanics
### Human Player (Neutral)
- Both Human Players have a chance to make an **Artefact** type attack at either **the Judge** or the **Head Referee**
- Human Players with better **Accuracy** stats have a higher chance of landing critical hits on the **Head Referee**, which can **temporarily stun them**
- The Human Player has a finite stock of **Artefacts**, which must be resupplied by 
### Head Referee Fist Fight
- Every **5 turns (30 seconds)**, there is a **20%** chance for both Human Players to leave their stations to spend the next **5 turns** fist fighting the **Head Referee**
- While the **Head Referee** is fighting the Human Players, it cannot charge any **Smite** attacks or cast status effects on robots
- Human Players deal damage equivalent to (***player strength*** x 10)
- To mimic the **Smite Ability**, the **Head Referee** has a **Taser**, which deals **Smite** damage for some reason
- Every turn, Human Player's **Agility** are used to determine if they are hit by the **Head Referee**'s **Smite** attack
	- Upon hit, they are **knocked down**, and will not be revived until the designated **5 turn** time slot is finished
- The Human Players return to their station if either the **Head Referee** is downed, or the **5 turn** time period finishes
- If one or both of the Human Players have the **Vengeful** trait, they will body slam the **Head Referee** after knocking them out, which is **equivalent to an extra knock out**.
