Covered in this guide is the operation of **BunyipsLib v7.3.2** in the [BunyipsFTC](https://git.bubner.me/bunyipsftc) project.

This guide is an introduction to setting up a robot's software, and bootstrapping a basic configuration that can be expanded
for more advanced features. Be sure to read the [BunyipsLib Wiki](https://bunyipslib.wiki.bubner.me/) for BunyipsLib-specific and advanced operations.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This guide is written as a basic bootstrap and quickstart for a BunyipsFTC robot using BunyipsLib. Hence, this guide is only valid for robots that use the REV Robotics Control Hub.

This guide is ordered sequentially. Use the arrows on the side of the screen or the navbar on the left to progress through the quickstart.
